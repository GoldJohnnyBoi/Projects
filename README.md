These are functional programs I created and implemented whilst working. 

Arduino Wheel Spin is for controlling a stepper motor to spin a wheel precisely for simulating arm movements.

Computer Vision is for taking two images, watering it down, and comparing the difference in pixels. This was to prevent accidents with automated lines.
